	included the possibility to manually set box dimensions (for xyz files)
	via the new keyword 'cubic_box_edge'
04.02.2020:
	performance fixes
29.01.2020:
	new keyword: remove_drudes, which writes a trajectory with the drude particles merged into cores (mass-weighted)
27.01.2020:
	fixed bug in diffusion module / user input
21.01.2020:
	bug fixes
20.01.2020:
	bug fixes
19.01.2020:
	Introduced radius of gyration
14.01.2020:
	Fixed issue in manual user input
	solved issue with f2003 compatibility
	I/O is now flushed after every analysis and before reading the trajectory
12.12.2019:
	Minor adjustments (mostly nicer output)
11.12.2019:
	Introduced feature to compute the effective temperature for centre of mass, whole trajectory, and drude particles.
06.12.2019:
	Added assignment of drude particles - both manual and automatic.
16.11.2019:
	Added missing question in user_reorientation_input
	cleaned up VERBOSE_OUTPUT in all modules
15.11.2019:
	Included copyright information and reference to GNU General Public License, version 3
14.11.2019:
	improved error handling when reading the whole trajectory at once (can deal with EOF while reading header now)
	also, added some descriptions for the reorientational time correlation feature.
12.11.2019:
	Added feature: reorientational time correlation function / vector orientation dynamics.
28.10.2019:
	Added the keyword 'dump_cut', which writes a trajectory of a certain molecule including its neighbours.
	(within a specified cutoff, and including periodic boundary conditions).
04.10.2019:
	Added 'export' to the dihedral autocorrelation module.
02.10.2019:
	Added flag '-d', which redirects the standard output (unit 6) to an output file.
	The standard output file is 'output.dat', but this can be changed by just appending the filename to the flag:
	'-dmyoutput' thus produces an output file 'myoutput', '-doutput.dat' is equal to the default.
01.10.2019:
	Added inofficial parallel conversion tool to developers version. Performance gain is pretty much nonexistent.
26.09.2019:
	changes in the temperature module, included function for the total temperature, included drudes
25.09.2019:
	changed the temperature calculation (constraints correction is now reported separately).
	In the developers version, TLAMMPS, TN as well as the two corrections are also reported.
03.09.2019:
	minor bugfixes, release information is now included in the output to ease identification of issues in retrospect.
23.08.2019:
	minor bugfixes. 'convert' now writes lower and upper box bounds, not just upper.
12.08.2019:
	load_trajectory_header_information now checks whether the element names in the first step are consistent.
	fixed bug (wrong sum formulae)
	introduced support for wrapping of molecules into the box. (using centre of mass, not cutting molecules.)
10.08.2019:
	Changed to fortran 2003 standard
	Added the keyword 'dump_single', which allows one to write a trajectory for one specific molecule.
08.08.2019:
	It is now possible to read (multiple!) general input files from the command line.
	Furthermore, the subroutine report_trajectory_properties now also prints the sum formulae.
07.08.2019:
	Fixed bug which would give the wrong check temperature in module 'Autocorrelation'
	(though results are not biased)
	trajectory type can now be recognised based on file extension '.xyz' or '.lmp'
	in addition to custom masses, constraints can now be specified (for correct temperature output).
	Also changed custom masses and constraints input to free format.
06.08.2019:
	included error handling for the 'temperature' keyword.
	cleared up some output.
	Turned on support for drude particle by means of specification of a custom mass for 'X'
05.08.2019:
	custom masses might now be specified as optional lines in the molecular input file.
04.08.2019:
	minor changes, like a more readable temperature output
03.08.2019:
	For velocity trajectories, the keyword 'temperature' is now available, which computes kinetic temperatures, including a drift correction.
30.07.2019:
	Decreased the accuracy in convert to single precision,
	minor bugfixes
29.07.2019:
	Added keyword 'convert', which produces a new trajectory containing only the centre of mass for every molecule.
	changed trajectory types to lowercase ('xyz' and 'lmp')
	turned on support for different trajectory types
	Temperature is predicted from the velocity correlation functions as a check.
25.07.2019:
	Increased accuracy of VCF output.
18.07.2019:
	Added the sampling_interval switch to the self-contributions.
	checks the trajectory header whether velocities or cartesians are present
16.07.2019:
	first (sort of) useful version.
