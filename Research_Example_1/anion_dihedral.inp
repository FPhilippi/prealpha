 1 ### Molecule type index (i.e. the molecule to observe)
 dihedral 2 ### dihedral autocorrelation + number of dihedral conditions to be fulfilled 
 1 5 6 9    0.0 150.0
 5 6 9 12    0.0 150.0
 skip_autocorrelation T  ### no autocorrelation, just the PES & indicences.
 fold T ### also check for the range (360-b) to (360-a), not just a to b
 dump_verbose T ### dump verbose information such as the PES subset population.
 bin_count 100 ### Setting the bin count to 100 (default is 100)

 This is an input file for the dihedral conditions analysis.
 To actually perform the implied calculations, it has to be referenced in 'general.inp'.
