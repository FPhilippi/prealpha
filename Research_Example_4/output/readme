Here, your output should appear.
There should be files starting with:
- "GLOBAL"    : the output of the cluster analysis using Li-P distances of 4.25 as cutoff
- "PAIRS"     : cluster analysis considering P-Li and O-Li pairs, distance = minimum from RDF
- "All-to-Li" : Lithium centred species and statistics
- "Li-to-All" : species and statistics centred on the anion (acceptor 1) and the glyme (acceptor 2)
